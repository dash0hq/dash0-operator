  # This allows to schedule a release immediately after merging a PR to main, and have the release's CI build be queued

  # them and let the run one after the other. The reason is that we build multi-arch container images on main and for
  # tags, which takes a really long time if there are changes. But once they have been build, Docker caching makes the
  # next builds fast again.
