  # build still works, the resulting image will not be pushed to any target registry. For pushes to the main branch, the
  # images are tagged with "main-dev", but not with a version x.y.z. Finally, for pushes to a tag (or when a tag is
  # created), the images are tagged with the version indicated by the tag respectively, and also with latest. That is:
  # Creating a GitHub release (or creating a git tag via other means) will trigger building images tagged with x.y.z
