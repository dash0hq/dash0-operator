    # We use the changed-files action to potentially skip the injector & instrumentation tests on PRs that contain no
    # changes for the instrumentation image. This is because running the tests requires to build the instrumentation
    # image for both arm64 and X86_64, and the cross-platform build is very slow (takes up to 15 minutes). We do
    # always run these steps when building the main branch or a tag though. By default, changed-files would compare
    # against the last non-merge commit on the target branch for pull request events (which is used in PR builds), but
    # together with the nrwl/nx-set-shas step from above we compare against the SHA from the last _successful_ CI

      # This can be worked around by ammending the Dependabot commit and force-pushing it, e.g.
      #   git commit --amend --signoff && git push --force-with-lease
      # (The original suspicion was that the HTTP 403 was somehow related to the image tag, but this is purely a
      # Dependabot permission issue.)
      # See also: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot
      # Maybe we can also allow Dependabot PRs to dry-run the Helm chart publishing, that is, remove the
      # github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]' condition we have on those steps.
