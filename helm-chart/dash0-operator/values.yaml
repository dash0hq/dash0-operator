# This file contains the default values for the Dash0 Kubernetes Operator Helm chart.
# Values can be overriden via --set or by providing additional yaml files when running helm install.

# settings for the operator/controller
operator:

  # Use the operator.dash0Export settings to configure the connection to the Dash0 backend; telemetry will be sent to
  # the configured Dash0 backend by default. Under the hood, this will create a Dash0OperatorConfiguration resource
  # right away, when starting the operator. If left empty, you can always create a Dash0OperatorConfiguration resource
  # manually later.
  dash0Export:
    # Set this to true to enable the creation of a Dash0OperatorConfiguration resource at startup. If a
    # Dash0OperatorConfiguration already exists in the cluster, no action will be taken. Note that if this is set to
    # true, you will also need to provide a valid endpoint (operator.dash0Export.endpoint), and either or an auth
    # token (operator.dash0Export.token) or a reference to a Kubernetes secret containing that token
    # (operator.dash0Export.secretRef).
    enabled: false

    # The URL of the Dash0 ingress endpoint to which telemetry data will be sent. This property is mandatory if
    # operator.dash0Export.enabled is true, otherwise it will be ignored. The value needs to be the OTLP/gRPC endpoint
    # of your Dash0 organization. The correct OTLP/gRPC endpoint can be copied fom https://app.dash0.com -> organization
    # settings -> "Endpoints". The correct endpoint value will always start with `ingress.` and end in `dash0.com:4317`.
    endpoint:

    # The Dash0 authorization token. This property is optional, but either this property or the secretRef configuration
    # has to be provided if operator.dash0Export.enabled is true. If operator.dash0Export.enabled is false, this
    # property will be ignored.
    # If both token and secretRef are provided, the token will be used and secretRef will be ignored. The authorization
    # token for your Dash0 organization can be copied from https://app.dash0.com -> organization settings ->
    # "Auth Tokens".
    token:

    # A reference to a Kubernetes secret containing the Dash0 authorization token. This property is optional, and is
    # ignored if either operator.dash0Export.enabled is false or operator.dash0Export.token is set. The authorization
    # token for your Dash0 organization can be copied from https://app.dash0.com -> organization settings ->
    # "Auth Tokens".
    secretRef:
      # The name of the secret containing the Dash0 authorization token. Example: Assume you have created the Kubernetes
      # secret with the following command:
      # kubectl create secret generic \
      #   dash0-authorization-secret \
      #   --namespace dash0-system \
      #   --from-literal=token=auth_...your-token-here...
      #
      # Then you would set the property to "dash0-authorization-secret".
      name:
      # The key of the value which contains the Dash0 authorization token. Assuming you have created the Kubernetes
      # secret with the command above (see property "name"), then you would set the property to "token".
