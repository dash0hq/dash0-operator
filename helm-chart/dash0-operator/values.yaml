# This file contains the default values for the Dash0 Operator Helm chart.
# Values can be overriden via --set or by providing additional yaml files when running helm install.

# Settings for the Dash0 operator:
operator:

  # Use the operator.dash0Export settings to configure the connection to the Dash0 backend; telemetry will be sent to
  # the configured Dash0 backend by default. Under the hood, this will make sure a Dash0OperatorConfiguration resource
  # will be created right away, when starting the operator. If left empty, you can always create a
  # Dash0OperatorConfiguration resource manually later.
  dash0Export:
    # Set this to true to enable the creation of a Dash0OperatorConfiguration resource at startup. If a
    # Dash0OperatorConfiguration already exists in the cluster, no action will be taken. Note that if this is set to
    # true, you will also need to provide a valid endpoint (operator.dash0Export.endpoint), and either an auth token
    # (operator.dash0Export.token) or a reference to a Kubernetes secret containing that token
    # (operator.dash0Export.secretRef).
    enabled: false

    # The URL of the Dash0 ingress endpoint to which telemetry data will be sent. This property is mandatory if
    # operator.dash0Export.enabled is true, otherwise it will be ignored. The value needs to be the OTLP/gRPC endpoint
    # of your Dash0 organization. The correct OTLP/gRPC endpoint can be copied fom https://app.dash0.com -> organization
    # settings -> "Endpoints" -> "OTLP/gRPC". The correct endpoint value will always start with `ingress.` and end in
    # `dash0.com:4317`.
    endpoint:

    # The dataset to be used for reported telemetry and API access. This property is optional, it defaults to "default".
    # See https://www.dash0.com/documentation/dash0/key-concepts/datasets.
    dataset:

    # The base URL of the Dash0 API to talk to. This is not where telemetry will be sent, but it is used for managing
    # dashboards and check rules via the operator. This property is mandatory. The value needs to be the API endpoint
    # of your Dash0 organization. The correct API endpoint can be copied fom https://app.dash0.com -> organization
    # settings -> "Endpoints" -> "API". The correct endpoint value will always start with "https://api." and end in
    # ".dash0.com"
    apiEndpoint:

    # The Dash0 authorization token. This property is optional, but either this property or the secretRef configuration
    # has to be provided if operator.dash0Export.enabled is true. If operator.dash0Export.enabled is false, this
    # property will be ignored.
    # If both token and secretRef are provided, the token will be used and secretRef will be ignored. The authorization
    # token for your Dash0 organization can be copied from https://app.dash0.com -> organization settings ->
    # "Auth Tokens".
    token:

    # A reference to a Kubernetes secret containing the Dash0 authorization token. This property is optional, and is
    # ignored if either operator.dash0Export.enabled is false or operator.dash0Export.token is set. The authorization
    # token for your Dash0 organization can be copied from https://app.dash0.com -> organization settings ->
    # "Auth Tokens".
    secretRef:
      # The name of the secret containing the Dash0 authorization token. Example: Assume you have created the Kubernetes
      # secret with the following command:
      # kubectl create secret generic \
      #   dash0-authorization-secret \
      #   --namespace dash0-system \
      #   --from-literal=token=auth_...your-token-here...
      #
      # Then you would set the property to "dash0-authorization-secret".
      name:
      # The key of the value which contains the Dash0 authorization token. Assuming you have created the Kubernetes
      # secret with the command above (see property "name"), then you would set the property to "token".
      key:

    # If secretRef is used, the Helm chart will check if the provided secret actually exists. Set this to true to
    # disable this check. This can be useful if you want to render the manifests via the Helm charts without accessing a
    # live Kubernetes cluster.
    disableSecretValidation: false

  # An opt-out for operator self-monitoring. If set to false, self monitoring for the operator will be disabled, that
  # is, the operator will not send self-monitoring telemetry to the configured Dash0 backend. This setting is optional,
  # it defaults to true.
  #
  # This setting has no effect if operator.dash0Export.enabled is false, as no Dash0OperatorConfiguration
  # resource will be created by the Helm chart then.
  selfMonitoringEnabled: true

  # An opt-out for collecting kubernetes infrastructure metrics. If set to false, the operator will not collect
  # Kubernetes infrastructure metrics. This setting is optional, it defaults to true.
  #
  # This setting has no effect if operator.dash0Export.enabled is false, as no Dash0OperatorConfiguration
  # resource will be created by the Helm chart then.
  kubernetesInfrastructureMetricsCollectionEnabled: true

  # If set, the value will be added as the resource attribute k8s.cluster.name to all telemetry. This setting is
  # optional. Per default, the resource attribute k8s.cluster.name will not be added.
  #
  # This setting has no effect if operator.dash0Export.enabled is false, as no Dash0OperatorConfiguration
  # resource will be created by the Helm chart then.

  # If set to true, it enables a set of config changes suitable for local development or troubleshooting:

    # A reference to a persistent volume to use for the filelog offset sync. Specify this is you have a cluster

    # for its peristent storage, but ConfigMaps are limited to 1 MB in size. If you have around 100 pods running in
    # your cluster, the recommendation is to provide volume.
    #
    # Here is an example with a hostPath volume (see also https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath
