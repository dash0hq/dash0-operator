                  This can either be Dash0 or another OTLP-compatible backend. You can also combine up to three exporters (i.e.
                  Dash0 plus gRPC plus HTTP). This allows sending the same data to two or three targets simultaneously. At least
                  one exporter has to be defined.

                  Please note that self-monitoring data is only sent to one backend, with Dash0 taking precedence over gRPC and
                  HTTP, and gRPC taking precedence over HTTP if multiple exports are defined. Furthermore, HTTP export with JSON
                  encoding is not supported for self-monitoring telemetry.
