# Note that these ignore instructions need to be valid for a couple of images with different purposes, like the main
# instrumentation image, but also the injector builder image used in injector/test. This is mostly about speeding up
# builds by not invalidating Docker layer caching unnecessarily. The files ending up in the main instrumentation image
# are not controlled by this .dockerignore file, they are carefully controlled by the last stage of the multi-stage
# Dockerfile, which only copies the relevant final artifacts from the various build stages.
