# compilation (specifically, cross-CPU-architecture compilation) for the multi-platform image on the platform/CPU
# architecture of the machine running the docker build, instead of running the build via emulation (QEMU); go build
# takes care of producing the correct binary for the target architecture on its own.
# See https://www.docker.com/blog/faster-multi-platform-builds-dockerfile-cross-compilation-guide/.
