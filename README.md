The Dash0 Operator makes observability for Kubernetes _easy_.
Install the operator into your cluster and create a Dash0 monitoring resource to get OpenTelemetry data flowing from your applications and
infrastructure to Dash0.

The Dash0 operator is currently available as a technical preview.

## Description

The Dash0 operator enables gathering OpenTelemetry data from your workloads for a selection of supported
runtimes, automatic log collection and metrics.

### Distributed tracing

Auto-instrumentation if supported for the following runtimes:

* Node.js 18 and beyond, using [Dash0 Node.js OpenTelemetry Distribution](https://github.com/dash0hq/opentelemetry-js-distribution)

For more information on how the Dash0 operator automatically traces your applications, see the [Automatic Workload Instrumentation](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dash0-operator/dash0-operator#automatic-workload-instrumentation) section of the Dash0 operator Helm chart documentation.

### Metrics

The Dash0 operator automatically collects cluster- and workload-related metrics, like node and pod cpu and memory usage.
It also supports scraping Prometheus endpoints exposed by pods according to the `prometheus.io/*` annotations defined by the Prometheus Helm chart:

For more information on how the Dash0 operator scrapes Prometheus endpoints exposed by your applications, see the [Scraping Prometheus endpoints](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dash0-operator/dash0-operator#scraping-prometheus-endpoints) section of the Dash0 operator Helm chart documentation.

### Alerting

The Dash0 operator supports the [`PrometheusRule` custom resource definition](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/blob/main/Documentation/api.md#monitoring.coreos.com/v1.PrometheusRule) defined by the Prometheus operator.
The alert rules specified in `PrometheusRule` custom resources are used to create [check rules](https://www.dash0.com/documentation/dash0/alerting/check-rules) in Dash0.

For more information on how the Dash0 operator creates check rules based on `PrometheusRule` resources, consult the [Managing Dash0 Check Rules](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/dash0-operator/dash0-operator#managing-dash0-check-rules) section of the Dash0 operator Helm chart documentation.

### Dashboards

The Dash0 operator supports the `PersesDashboard` custom resource definition defined by the [Perses operator](https://github.com/perses/perses-operator).
The Perses dashboards specified in `PersesDashboard` custom resources are used to create [dashboards](https://www.dash0.com/documentation/dash0/dashboards) in Dash0.

## Getting Started

The preferred method of installation is via the operator's
[Helm chart](https://github.com/dash0hq/dash0-operator/blob/main/helm-chart/dash0-operator/README.md).

The [Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/dash0hq/dash0-operator/blob/main/helm-chart/dash0-operator/README.md)
also contains all other relevant information for getting started with the operator, like how to enable Dash0 monitoring
for your workloads etc.
