# See CONTRIBUTING.md -> "Running End-to-End Tests on kind" for instructions to run e2e tests on a kind cluster.

# Before creating a cluster with this config, the two hostPath settings below need to be aligned with your local file
# system structure.
#
# Alternatively, create a symbolic link from
# /Users/username/dash0/code/dash0-operator/test-resources/e2e/volumes to the actual path, with "username" as a literal
# (do not replace this with your actual username).
#
# That is, run the following commands:
#     mkdir -p /Users/username/dash0/code/dash0-operator/test-resources/e2e
#     cd /Users/username/dash0/code/dash0-operator/test-resources/e2e/volumes
#     ln -s /${the-actual-path-to-your-dash0-operator-repository}/test-resources/e2e/volumes volumes
#
# Also, make sure the path mentioned under `hostPath` is listed in Docker Desktop's settings under
# "Resources -> File sharing".
