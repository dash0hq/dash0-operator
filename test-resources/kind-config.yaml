# See CONTRIBUTING.md -> "Running End-to-End Tests on kind" for instructions to run e2e tests on a kind cluster.

# Before creating a cluster with this config, the two hostPath settings below need to be aligned with your local file
# system structure. Alternatively, create a symbolic link from
# /Users/username/dash0/code/dash0-operator/test-resources/e2e-test-volumes/ to the actual path.
# Also, make sure the path mentioned under `hostPath` is listed in Docker Desktop's settings under
# "Resources -> File sharing".
