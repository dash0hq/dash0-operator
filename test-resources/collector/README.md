Note: Deploying the OpenTelemetry collector separately is only useful when deploying the Dash0 operator via kustomize.
When deploying the operator via Helm, the chart will also deploy the collector as well.
The files in this folder might not be maintained as diligently as the rest of the repository, as deployment via 
kustomize is not the preferred method of installation.
