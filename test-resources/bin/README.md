Test Scripts
============

The scripts in this folder are meant for running semi-manual tests.
They deploy the operator and applications under monitoring - this part is automated via scripts.
Whether the instrumentation was successful or not needs to be verified manually.
This can also be tested in a fully automated way by the tests in `test/e2e`.
