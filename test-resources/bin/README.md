Test Scripts
============

The scripts in this folder are meant for running semi-manual tests.
They deploy the operator and applications under monitoring - this part is automated via scripts.
Whether the instrumentation was successful or not needs to be verified manually.
There is also an extensive suit of fully automated tests in `test/e2e`.

The section "Semi-Manual Test Scenarios" in CONTRIBUTING.md has more details on the scripts in this folder.
