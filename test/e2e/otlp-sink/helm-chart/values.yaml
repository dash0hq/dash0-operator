  # We could also use an emptyDir volume by default, but using a hostPath volume gives you a chance to look into the
  # captured telemetry for troubleshooting purposes when a test case fails.
  # The *.jsonl files are truncated by the file exporter at startup, so while the files remain on disk after the e2e
  # test suite has finished, they are discarded at the next start (i.e. they will not grow indefinitely on disk).
